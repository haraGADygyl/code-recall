# Python Asyncio\n\nAsyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.\n\nAsyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.
